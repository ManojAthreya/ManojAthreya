- Investigated the generation of high-quality code datasets using the Self-Instruct method on CodeLlama.
- Conducted finetuning and evaluation processes to enhance Mistral 7B's performance on the given datasets.
- Successfully surpassed the score of the base model, demonstrating proficiency in model training and evaluation.


**Summarization of Customer Feedback: Reviews, Complaints and Suggestions**

- Web Scraped data from shopping sites, preprocessed and cleaned 80k samples using regular expressions.
- Applied K-means Clustering on the data to classify into clusters to form a Semi-Supervised Learning.
- Fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model to generate abstractive summaries of feedback and evaluated with ROUGE & BLEU.
- The summaries provided valuable insights that are leveraged to enhance customer satisfaction and business strategies.

**Twitter Data ETL Project**

- The goal of the project is to extract tweets from Twitter(X) and store them in an Azure DB for analysis.
- Collection of information on a specific topic from Twitter(X) user comments and summarize the issue.
- Developed an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow and Pyspark to load the Twitter data into the data warehouse.
- Extracted and stored real-time tweets from Twitter, enabling our team to perform to use for summarization tasks.

**StackOverflow Tag Prediction**

- Predict tags for StackOverflow questions using NLP and Machine Learning Algorithms.
- Data Collection through web scrapping from the website and preprocessing them using NLTK library.
- Trained the BERT model with suitable training parameters which improved the F1-Score efficiency by 5%.
- Achieved an improved F1-Score on the accuracy of tag prediction for questions using the deep learning approach.
